            <strong>For our out-of-state guests:</strong> We recommend flying
            into any of the major Northern California airports (**SFO, OAK, SJC,
            SAC**) and renting a car. You may also fly into Mammoth Yosemite
            Airport (**MMH**), Merced Regional Airport (**MCE**), or
            Fresno-Yosemite International Airport (**FAT**), but these smaller
            airports have fewer flights.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Driving warning:</strong> There is a stretch of **Hwy 120
            into Groveland** called **Priest Grade**, which has several
            switchbacks and limited nighttime visibility. While both **New
            Priest Grade and Old Priest Grade** are relatively short, they can
            be dangerous for unfamiliar drivers. Please keep this in mind for
            travel and lodging plans.
